## Abstract

Headlines are the marquees of news stories. These short statements at the beginning of an article frame the information that is to follow and encapsulate a portion of the story, presenting a snapshot of reality. For many outlets navigating the changes associated with digital journalism, news headlines have changed as well. In addition to traditional headlines that highlight the important aspects of the story, headlines are being crafted to arouse curiosity, pose intriguing questions, or lead to specific conclusions. Industry insiders refer to non-traditional headlines that attempt to entice readers to a news page as "Clickbait." The question with these new headline formats is whether the way a title is written has an impact on how readers perceive the news source. In this research, we utilize ensemble modelling in an attempt to assess the reliability of the headlines by determining whether the content matches the headline or is simply outlandish to garner clicks.
